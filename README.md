# Expandable-cards
A project from an Udemy course where I implemented some Javascript, html and css, this is a basic project, it is about expandable cards to show, places, person, information
or anything that you want to show. Mine is about places, so i have taken some pictures from unsplash an placed them into my project. I chose them because these places are where i want to travel, except for Venezuela
due to the reason that is my country.
